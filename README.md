# Supply Chain Analysis

## Problem Statement:
In the rapidly evolving landscape of our supply chain operations, there is an increasing need for data-driven insights to optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance overall performance. Our organization is seeking to leverage advanced analytics to gain a comprehensive understanding of our supply chain dynamics.

## The primary objectives of this project are:

### 1) Sales and Revenue Analysis:
Investigate the sales performance and revenue generation across different product types, SKU variations, and pricing strategies.
Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that can inform strategic decisions to maximize sales and revenue.

### 2) Logistics and Transportation Optimization:
Analyze shipping costs and transportation modes to identify opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency improvement.
Evaluate defect rates and their correlation with transportation methods to enhance product quality during transit.

### 3) Inventory Management:
Examine stock levels across SKUs to optimize inventory management and prevent stockouts or overstock situations.
Explore the correlation between defect rates and stock levels to understand the impact on product availability.

### 4) Quality Control:
Assess defect rates by product type to identify potential areas for improvement in manufacturing processes.
Visualize average defect rates across different product types to prioritize quality control efforts.

### 5) Overall Supply Chain Performance:
Integrate findings from sales, logistics, inventory, and quality analyses to provide a holistic view of supply chain performance.
Propose recommendations for strategic improvements and operational enhancements to streamline the supply chain.

## 6) Tools and Technologies:
Utilize Python programming language with relevant libraries such as Pandas, Plotly,nump and other data analysis tools to conduct a thorough and insightful supply chain analysis.


## Key insights 

1) Skincare" is the leading product type in terms of the number of products sold, with 20,731 units.
"Cosmetics" follows with 11,757 units sold, and "Haircare" with 13,611 units sold.Among the product categories, "Haircare" has the highest shipping costs, followed by "Skincare" and "Cosmetics."

2) Among "Cosmetics" SKUs, SKU38, SKU85, and SKU88 are the top revenue generators. For "Haircare," SKU0, SKU51, and SKU48 are the leading revenue contributors. In the "Skincare" category, SKU31, SKU32, and SKU34 are the top performers.The highest revenue is generated by SKU51, which has a revenue of approximately 9,866.The lowest revenue is generated by SKU59, which has a revenue of approximately 1,061

3) The "skincare" category has the highest share of products sold, accounting for approximately 45% of the total.SKUs with high stock levels, such as SKU12, SKU21, and SKU23, may require a review of the demand forecast and sales performance to ensure that excess inventory is not tying up capital.SKUs with low or zero stock levels, such as SKU68 and SKU34, may require immediate attention to avoid stockouts and potential revenue loss.

4) Kolkata stands out as the location with the highest shipping costs.Bangalore and Chennai have relatively lower shipping costs compared to Kolkata and Mumbai.

5) The defect rates vary by product type. Cosmetics have the lowest average defect rate at about 1.92%, indicating a relatively lower rate of defects in cosmetic products. On the other hand, haircare and skincare products have higher average defect rates, with haircare at about 2.48% and skincare at about 2.33%.

6) Road transportation has the highest share of shipping costs, accounting for 29% of the total.Both Air and Rail have an equal share of 28% each.Sea transportation has the lowest share at 15%. Road transport plays a crucial role in the logistical framework, possibly offering advantages such as flexibility, accessibility, or timeliness for the goods being transported.
